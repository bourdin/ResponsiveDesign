# ResponsiveDesign
This code was written as part of the research project "Systematic design of compliant morphing structures: a phase-field approach" submitted for publication by Jamal Shabani <shabanij@mcmaster.ca>, Kaushik Bhattacharya <bhatta@caltech.edu>, Blaise Bourdin <bourdin@mcmaster.ca>.

We cordially ask that any project leveraging this code references the following works:
   * Jamal Shabani, Kaushik Bhattacharya, Blaise Bourdin, 2024. "Systematic design of compliant morphing structures: a phase-field approach" <DOI to be inserted later>.
   * ResponsiveDesign (this code) DOI:10.5281/zenodo.12746321  

## Using ResponsiveDesigns:
   * This codes requires the firedrake project https://www.firedrakeproject.org . 
   * Instructions and data files required to reproduce the figures are hosted by the Federated Research Data Repository (FRDR) archive at DOI:10.20383/103.01009
